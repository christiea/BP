								<h2>About Big Picture</h2>
								<p>Big picture is a project that aims to connect people who travel similar paths but don't physically cross paths so we create a network of users who share a common ground and allow them to cross internet paths and compare experiences. Each visitor to a location has the chance to be apart of this joint exploration of our lands, seas and views all from their phones, laptops and other wifi-camera devices.</p>

								<h2>How does it work?<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Go to one of the many places we include on the app. You will find a branded sticker on a noticeable sign.There will be a QR code on this sticker unique to this location. Scan this using the "scan QR" feature on our app. The app takes you to the home page for the location. Since you have scanned this QR you now have full access to all the features of this group. Sharing and viewing photos with/of other users. You can interact with other group members and see how many groups/Location you have in common. You can message and interact with other users as long as both user's privacy permissions allow this.</p>

								<h2>Why?<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Everyone is obsessed with scenic photography and scenic locations, but they aren't willing to go to the actual location to capture or view it for themself. After the restrictions that have been in place for 2020 Big Picture aims to encourage people to go and explore while you can, because as we all learnt and are continuing to learn these abilities can be changed in the shutter of a camera. We want to give some guidance and community networks to connect and help people achieve their location attending dreams.</p>

								<h2>Target Audience<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The target audience for Big Picture is anyone who has an interest in the outdoors, views and basic photography skills, and wanting to be apart of an online and offline community. The app only allows you to be apart of the locations group if you scan the QR code at the location, so the more places you go the more locations you collect. It turns travelling into a reward, by gaining physical access to the QR code you gain access to a group of people who have also been to that place and as we all know being apart of something is better than being left out. We as humans thrive on connections and those connections have more and more gone online. This is great but we still want people to go outside and explore the beauty of nature and then connect to others who share their locations.</p>

								<h2>Aim<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The aim of Big Picture is to create and inspire people to go out and explore. There is a very negative perception on excessive internet users that they are lazy and unfit. Big Picture aims to create an online community to assist in other users adventures and connect people with a like mind for beautiful views. Often when people go to see a site it’s only once they get to see that area but what if it was bad weather that day? or a day prior to that there was a gorgeous sunset, the collage allows users to see how everyone else saw it. </p>
